  <name>Chromium B.S.U.</name>
  <summary>Fast paced, arcade-style, top-scrolling space shooter</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      You are captain of the cargo ship Chromium B.S.U., responsible for
      delivering supplies to our troops on the front line. Your ship has a
      small fleet of robotic fighters which you control from the relative
      safety of the Chromium vessel. This is an OpenGL-based shoot 'em up
      game with fine graphics.
    </p>
    <p>Your mission:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Do not let ANY enemy ships get past your fighters! Each enemy ship that makes it past the bottom of the screen will attack the Chromium, and you lose a fighter.</li>
     <li>Use your fighters as weapons! Crash into enemies to destroy them before they can get past you.</li>
     <li>Strategic suicide is a powerful tactic! When the Chromium launches a new fighter, it releases a high energy burst which destroys all enemies in range.</li>
     <li>Self-destruct to preserve your ammunition! A double-right-click will cause your current fighter to self-destruct. Before the ship blows up, it ejects its ammunition so that the next fighter can pick it up.</li>
    </ul>
